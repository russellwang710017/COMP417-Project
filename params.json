People’s daily lives are filled with computers, cell phones, Internet, etc. Among the quickly evolving technologies, robots and intelligent systems have become an increasingly important part of the society. More and more routine procedures that used to be performed by human labor can now be done by robots. The ultimate goal is to let robots function intelligently and autonomously, just like a human being. Therefore, Robotics research topics include localization, motion planning, computer vision, and kinematics, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nWhile the use of robots for repetitive yet high-risk acts such as car-manufacturing is not a new idea, the use of robots to perform works that require more intelligence such as playing Go is the popular research interest nowadays. While the process of learning and logical reasoning is rather intuitive for human species, to enable artificial intelligence to perform the same act requires extensive research on artificial intelligence and machine learning. In other words, human have to come up with intelligent algorithms for robots to learn and reason like human. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?

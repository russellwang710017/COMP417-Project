Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\nImplementation of Several Planning and Navigation Algorithms Using Minecraft as Experimental Platform\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nEntering the first leaf of the 21st century, the world is bound with technology. People’s daily lives are filled with computers, cell phones, Internet, etc. Among the quickly evolving technologies, robots and intelligent systems have become an increasingly important part of the society. More and more routine procedures that used to be performed by human labor can now be done by robots. The ultimate goal is to let robots function intelligently and autonomously, just like a human being. Therefore, Robotics research topics include localization, motion planning, computer vision, and kinematics, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nWhile the use of robots for repetitive yet high-risk acts such as car-manufacturing is not a new idea, the use of robots to perform works that require more intelligence such as playing Go is the popular research interest nowadays. While the process of learning and logical reasoning is rather intuitive for human species, to enable artificial intelligence to perform the same act requires extensive research on artificial intelligence and machine learning. In other words, human have to come up with intelligent algorithms for robots to learn and reason like human. \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
